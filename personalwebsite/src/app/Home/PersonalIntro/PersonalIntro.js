                        <p>I'm a 24 year-old software engineering graduate from Montr√©al, Canada. As a product-oriented full-stack developer, I have been able to work in many fast-paced start-up environments while acquiring experience in web technologies such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular and more. You'll find on this website some of the work I had the chance to do in the past years, with a bit more insight on my professional experience. Feel free to reach out!</p>
